# College Manager in Flask
This is a simple flask and flask_sqlalchemy CRUD app where you can play around with
1. students
2. instructors
3. courses
4. departments
The database tables have multiple relationships, for example,
1. many students can enroll in many courses
2. departments can have one head
3. instructors can teach many courses
4. instructoes can advise many students
5. department can have many  courses

I built this app because I wanted to explore flask and its capabilities with sql_alchemy
There is also a reset database button in the navbar.
